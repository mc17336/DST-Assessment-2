This means that the likelihood of obtaining the same sample the team members got by running this code are far too small.\n\n**One may skip all this file and obtain the result directly from** [here](https://github.com/mc17336/DST-Assessment-2/blob/main/Data/MAC.zip).\n\nThis acknowledgment (and code) exist/are presented for _record keeping purposes only_.
