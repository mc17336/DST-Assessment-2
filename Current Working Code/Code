      ## Hi guys! I'll use this space to determine what I've done
      ## Feel free to change things up (but comment if you do so please - so we can all make sense of the changes)
      ## or ask questions about bits of code (again, via commenting)

    ## Reading the data        
setwd("D://R-4.0.2//ExcelWorks")
data<- read.csv(file = "MAC.csv", header = T) 
head(data, 50)
    ## USE THIS: We don't need 1st column - see time analysis discussion on discord
          ## Our data is sampled => Can't do reliable time analysis
data<- data[, -1]
# d <- data[data$service == "http", ]

    ## How many NA's in duration
c<- 0
for( i in 1:nrow(data)) {
	if(is.na(data$duration[i])) 
	c <- c+1 }
	}
  print(c)
  
  c*100/nrow(data) ## 82.76% of the durations are missing... weird

    ## Analysis of ICMP protocols
dOTH <- data[data$conn_state=="OTH", ]
table(data$proto)
table(dOTH$proto)	## OTH contains ALL icmp protocols

t<- table(data$conn_state)
pie(t, labels = names(t))	## OTH is just a small fraction of the states
                          ## Most prevelant states are 'REJ' and 'S0' (Server zero?)
                  ##  Why does OTH have all ICMP, although it's so small otherwise? -- ...
